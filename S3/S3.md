# S3 (Simple Storage Service)

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS
- Its advertised as "Infinite scalling" storage
- Many websites use S3 as backbone and many services use s3 as an intergration.


**Use Cases**

- Backup and storage
- Disaster recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website


Buckets (Directories, unique name(across all regions and all accounts))
  - objects(files)

- Buckets are defined at the region level (S3 looks like a global service but the buckets are region specific )
- Naming Convention
   - No uppercase, no underscore
   - 3-63 char long
   - Not an IP
   - Must start with lowecase letter or nummber
   - must not start with prefix xn--
   - must not end with suffic -s3alias

Objects:

- objects have a key
- key is the full path 
    ex: s3://my-bucket/*my_file.txt*
        s3://my-bucket/*my_folder/my_file.txt*
    - Key = prefix + object name
- There is no concepts of directories within buckets. Just keys with very long names.
- Objects values are content of the body
- Max Object size is 5TB (5000GB)
- if uploading more than 5GB multi-part upload is must
- Metadata (list of key/value pairs - system or user metadata)
- Tags (Unicode key/value pair) - usefull for security /lifecycle
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled) 


## S3 Security

- User based: IAM policies- which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
- Resource Based: 
    -  Bucket Policies: bucket wide rules from S3 console - allows cross account
    -  Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain (can be disabled)
    -  Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common (can be disabled)  

- If IAM policies are allowed or resource policy is allowed and if there is no expilict deny an IAM Principle can access the bucket
- Encryption :encrypt objects in AWS S3 using encryption keys


### S3 bukcet policies:

- Json based policies:
    - Resource: buckets and objects
    - Effect : allow or deny
    - Actions : get, put, and delete etc.
    - Principal: Aws account user, role and root user
- S3 bucket policy can be used to:
    - grant public access to the bucket
    - force objects to be encrypted at upload
    - grant cross access to another account 

```json

```

- Bucket setting to block public access take priity over the bucket policies
- Used to avoid data leaks
- Can be set at te account level

## Static Web Hosting

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the internet
- The website url will be based on the url (http://bucket-name.s3-website.aws-region.amazomaws.com or  http://bucket-name.s3-website-aws-region.amazomaws.com)

- enable the static webhosting in properties and add the index.html file

## Versioning

- you can version your files in AWS S3
- It is enabled in bucket level
- same key overwrite will chnage the version: 1,2,3,4...
- The files can be protected against the unintended dletes and easy to roll back to previous version.

Note: Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling will have version null
